/* The program 'insert_sort' takes the size of the array, 
/* the minimum and maximum elements as an argument. 
/* The program fills the array using the 'random' 
/* function with natural numbers from the specified 
/* interval. Then, using a function written in 
/* assembler, the array is sorted using the 
/* 'insert sort' method. Further, at the request 
/* of the user, the program displays the original 
/* and sorted arrays and the total amount of time 
/* spent on sorting. The program shows the average 
/* amount of time spent by the 'insert sort' function, 
/* written in C and in assembler. 
/* The number of repetitions is 10.
